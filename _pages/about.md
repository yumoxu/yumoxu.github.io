I am an NLP scientist at [AWS AI Labs](https://www.amazon.science/) researching and building intelligent language services for enterprises. 

My current interests lie in the following areas:
- Effective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems,
- Accurate faithfulness evaluation and source attribution, and
- Reliable autonomous agents with generalizable tool-use capabilities.

<!-- My primary research focus has been on [summarization](https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/39624), the process of condensing a source text into a shorter version while preserving its salient information.
My interests extend to other areas of AI/NLP such as controllable generation and scalable alignment. -->

Prior to Amazon, 
I received my PhD in NLP at [the University of Edinburgh](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc), advised by [Prof. Mirella Lapata](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/). 
My PhD research topic was on [text summarization](https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/39624), the process of condensing a source text into a shorter version while preserving its salient information.

<!-- My long-term research goal is to evolve the machine to interact with people naturally and assist people effectively, 
with minimal human guidance. -->
<!-- My PhD thesis [Document Summarization with Neural Query Modeling](https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/39624) was examined by [Prof. Ivan Titov](http://ivan-titov.org/) and [Prof. Greg Durrett](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gdurrett/). -->
