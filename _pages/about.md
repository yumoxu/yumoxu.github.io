I am a Research Associate at the University of Edinburgh working on Natural Language Processing, including text summarization and language generation. 
<!-- My long-term research goal is to evolve the machine to interact with people naturally and assist people effectively, 
with minimal human guidance. -->

<!-- I am fortunate to work closely with [Prof. Mirella Lapata](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/) who was also my PhD advisor.  -->
<!-- with a thesis entitled [Document Summarization with Neural Query Modeling](https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/39624) -->
I received my PhD degree at the University of Edinburgh in 2022, advised by [Prof. Mirella Lapata](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/). 
My PhD thesis [Document Summarization with Neural Query Modeling](https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/39624) was examined by [Prof. Ivan Titov](http://ivan-titov.org/) and [Prof. Greg Durrett](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gdurrett/).
