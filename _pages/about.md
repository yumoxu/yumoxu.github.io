Welcome! I am a final-year PhD student in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at the University of Edinburgh. I am affiliated with [the Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation (ILCC)](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) and also a member of [EdinburghNLP](http://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mirella Lapata](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/) (principle) and [Dr. Shay Cohen](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/).

I am interested in both deep neural networks and probabilistic models for NLP tasks, especially **text summarization** and **dialogue systems**. My long-term research goal is to evolve the machine to interact with people naturally and assist people effectively, with only a small amount of data.
