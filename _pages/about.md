Welcome! I am a Research Associate in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at the University of Edinburgh. 
I am fortunate to work closely with [Prof. Mirella Lapata](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/) who was also my PhD advisor. 
I recently finished my PhD with a thesis entitled Document Summarization with Neural Query Modeling, 
examined by [Prof. Ivan Titov](http://ivan-titov.org/) and [Prof. Greg Durrett](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gdurrett/).

I am interested in both neural networks and probabilistic models for NLP, 
especially text summarization and language generation. 
My long-term research goal is to evolve the machine to interact with people naturally and assist people effectively, 
with minimal human guidance.
