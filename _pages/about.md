Welcome! I am a Research Associate in Natural Language Processing at the University of Edinburgh, affiliated with [the Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation (ILCC)](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) and [EdinburghNLP](http://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/). 
I recently finished my PhD at the University of Edinburgh under the supervison of [Prof. Mirella Lapata](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/).
My thesis on Document Summarization with Neural Query Modeling was examined by [Dr. Ivan Titov](http://ivan-titov.org/) and [Dr. Greg Durrett](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gdurrett/).

I am interested in both deep learning and probabilistic models for NLP, 
specially [document summarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization),
[question anwering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_answering),
and [dialogue systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_system). 
My long-term research goal is to evolve the machine to interact with people naturally and assist people effectively, with minimal human guidance.
