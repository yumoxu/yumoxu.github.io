Welcome! I am a final-year PhD candidate in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at the University of Edinburgh. I am affiliated with [the Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation (ILCC)](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) and [EdinburghNLP](http://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mirella Lapata](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/).

I am interested in both deep learning and probabilistic models for NLP tasks. 
My PhD topic is **text summarization** and I am also a fan of **dialogue systems**. 
My long-term research goal is to evolve the machine to interact with people naturally and assist people effectively, with only a small amount of data. [[I am on the job market!]](https://yumoxu.github.io/news/announcement_5/)
