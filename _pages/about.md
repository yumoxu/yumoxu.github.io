Welcome! I am a final-year PhD candidate in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at the University of Edinburgh, affiliated with [the Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation (ILCC)](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) and [EdinburghNLP](http://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mirella Lapata](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/).

I am interested in both deep learning and probabilistic models for NLP tasks. 
My PhD topic is [document summarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization) and I am also a fan of [dialogue systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_system). 
My long-term research goal is to evolve the machine to interact with people naturally and assist people effectively, with minimal human guidance.
