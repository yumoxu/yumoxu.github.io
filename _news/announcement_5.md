 I am wrapping up my PhD (on the last project!) and will be on the job market in late 2021. 

 I am mainly interested in <span style="color:blue">**research scientist/engineer**</span> roles in NLP, preferably in <span style="color:blue">**US, UK or Switzerland**</span>. I am also open to <span style="color:blue">**postdoctoral positions**</span> if the research scope fits my research interests.

 If you think I could be a good fit for your position, feel free to [give me an email](mailto:yumo.xu@ed.ac.uk)!

 Please keep reading this post should you be interested in knowing more about my research.

**About my research interests**

My PhD topic is about Query-Focused Summarization, which is a very important and promising direction in text summarization. Broadly, I hold passion in a range of NLP tasks including summarization, dialogue systems, IR and QA, partially due to the fact that these tasks overlap quite a lot. 
<!-- Due to the limited amount of time I have during PhD study, I am not able to dive into every one of them. Nevertheless, I do constantly check recent progress in these areas, and maintain reading lists/notes for them.  -->

**About my research methodology**

 During my PhD, I received systematic training on how to approach a research problem, and dig into a given direction persistently from different perspectives, including tasks, datasets, models and algorithms.

 I favor a task-driven approach in my research -- not sure if there is a better term for this, but I call it a **bottom-up** approach: I always start from dataset/error analysis to gain a better understanding what the real bottleneck is, before playing with fancy model structures.
 This **bottleneck diagnosis** step is crucial to my research. It inspires me from the methodological perspective, and also sustains my motivation tiil the end of research, so that I am able to fix the problem with strong belief in the value of my work.

 I believe this is a good tactic not only to lots of academic problems; it is effective in solving more practical problems as well. Therefore, apart from keeping research outputs, I am also excited about building industrial NLP/ML applications, which, in turn, will guide me to produce higher-quality research that can be adopted in the real world with positive impact on a larger community.
