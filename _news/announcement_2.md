 I am wrapping up my PhD (on the last project!) and will be on the job market in late 2021.

**About my research interests**

My PhD topic is about Query-Focused Summarization, which is a very important and promising direction in text summarization. Broadly, I hold passion in a range of NLP tasks including summarization, dialogue systems, IR and QA, partially due to the fact that these tasks overlap quite a lot. 
Due to the limited amount of time I have during PhD study, I am not able to dive into every one of them. Nevertheless, I do constantly check recent progress in these areas, and maintain reading lists for them. 

**About my research method**

 During my PhD, I received systematic training on how to approach a research problem, and digging into a given direction continuously from different perspectives, including tasks, datasets, models and algorithms.

 I always favor a task-driven approach in my research. Sometimes I call it a *bottom-up* appraoch: before playing with fancy model structures, I always start from dataset/error analysis to gain a better understanding what the real bottleneck is. 
 This *bottleneck identification* step is crucial to my research. It inspires me from the methodological perspective, and also sustains my motivation, so that I am able to fix the problem with strong belief in the value of my work.

 I believe this is a good tactic not only to lots of academic problems; it is effective in solving more practical problems as well. Therefore, I am excited about building NLP/ML applications in industry, which, in turn, will guide me to produce higher-quality research that can be adopted in the real world with positive impact on a larger community.

**About my job expectation**

 I am mainly interested in **research {scientist, engineer}** roles in NLP, preferably in **{US, UK, Switzerland}**. 

 I am also open to **postdoctoral positions** if the research scope fits my research interests as mentioned above.

 If you think I could be a good fit for your position, please feel free to give me an email!
