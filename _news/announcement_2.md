 I am wrapping up my PhD (last project!) and will be on the job market in late 2021.
 
 I am mainly interested in **research {scientist, engineer}** roles in NLP, preferably in **{US, UK, Switzerland}**. 
 
 I am also open to **postdoctoral positions** if it matches my research interests (i.e., summarization and dialogue systems).
 
 If you think I can be a good fit for your position, please feel free to give me an email  :sparkles:
